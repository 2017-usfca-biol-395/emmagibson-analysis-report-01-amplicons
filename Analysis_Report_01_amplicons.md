Introduction
============

Add about 1.5-2 pages here. Must cite at least 5 peer reviewed articles.

Methods
=======

Sample origin and sequencing
----------------------------

Fierer *et al.* obtained the riginal samples from human volunteers and the keyboards/mice they touched. They collected them with sterilized cotton-tipped swabs that had been moistened by a sterile solution. They swabbed the hands midday, and swabbed the mice and keyboards within 12 hours of being used by their respective owners. All of the subjects they sampled were healthy, between 20-35 years old, and had not taken antibiotics 6 months before the sampling. They stored all swabs at -80 degrees celcius for less than a week before DNA extraction.Fierer *et al.* obtained the becterial gene sequences using high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene.

Computational
-------------

I proscessed and analyzed the sequence data using a combination of bash and R. First, I used bash to proscess the samples in order to determine their length and quality. Sequences of sufficient quality were then analyzed in R, using all of the relevant metadata and sequence information. R analyses were conducted through the usage of base R, as well as vegan, DADA2, and phyloseq. Vegan was used for various statistical analyses, such as to create rarefaction curves. DADA2 was used for inter-sequence analysis, such as forming OTUs and resolving minor sequence differences (Callahan *et al.*, 2016). Phyloseq was used to add various microbiome-specific functions to ggplot in order to better visualize the data (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013).

Results
=======

In addition to a minimum of 3-4 figures/tables (and associated captions), you should include sufficient text in this section to describe what your findings were. Remember that in the results section you just describe what you found, but you don't interpret it - that happens in the discussion.

# Sort ensures samples are in order
filenames_forward_reads <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = ".fastq"))

# Extract sample names, assuming filenames have format: SAMPLENAME.fastq

plotQualityProfile(filenames_forward_reads[1:20])
```

![](Analysis_Report_01_amplicons_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/check-quality-plots-1.png)

We can see from the quality profiles that most reads tend to get pretty bad in quality after around 200 bases. Therefore, we decided to set a maximum acceptable sequence length of 225 bases.

``` r
# produce the 'site by species matrix'
sequence_table <- makeSequenceTable(dada_forward_reads)
```

    ## The sequences being tabled vary in length.

The output table has 20 rows (samples) and 178 columns (sequence variants). Notice how we can embed R code directly in our markdown text.

``` r
# Quick check to look at distribution of trimmed and denoised sequences
hist(nchar(getSequences(sequence_table)),
     main = "Histogram of fingal sequence variant lengths",
     xlab = "Sequence length in bp")
```

``` r
# Check for and remove chimeras
sequence_table_nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(sequence_table,
                                            method = "consensus",
                                            multithread = FALSE,
                                            verbose = TRUE)
```

    ## Identified 2 bimeras out of 178 input sequences.

``` r
# What percent of our reads are non-chimeric?
non_chimeric_reads <- round(sum(sequence_table_nochim) / sum(sequence_table),
                            digits = 4) * 100
```

After removing chimeras, we were left with 99.65% of our cleaned reads.

``` r
# Build a table showing how many sequences remain at each step of the pipeline

### Figure 1. Rarefaction curve of species diversity in male and female hands

This figure shows rarefaction curves for male hands, female hands, and mouse/keyboard samples. This type of analysis takes both sample size and sample diversity into account, and functions on the assumption that the more samples are taken from a specific community, the more diversity will be found.

``` r
# this code looks at alpha diversity in male vs female hands
subsetted_pls_obj <- subset_samples(phyloseq_obj, sex_s != "Not applicable")
# this subset removes mouse data from the dataset
plot_richness(subsetted_pls_obj,
              x = "sex_s",
              measures = c("Shannon", "Simpson")) +
  xlab("Sample origin") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sex_s),
               width = 0.2) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Alpha diversity in male vs female hands")
```

This figure shows boxplots that represent the total diversity in both male and femalle hands, using both Shannon and Simpson diversity metrics.

```

### Figure 3. Abundance of various phylums in each sex

This figure shows a bar graph that represents the relative abundance of bacterial phylums in each hand, sepparated by sex.

``` r
# this code looks at the differences in diversity between
# male and female hands compared to the mice they used

# this next line tells R to only consider the first letter
# of the host ID (M2, F4, etc.), so the figure splits by sex
  facet_wrap(~ substr(metadata_in$host_subject_id_s, 1, 1),

    ## We recommended that you find the un-trimmed data and retry.

### Figure 4. Diversity in human hands compared to their respective mice

This figure shows the Shannon diversity in each human hand, compared to the respective mouse that individual used.

``` r
# this code looks at the abundance of each phylum in each
# individual, and again pairs humans with their mice
ggplot(melted_phyloseq_obj,
        aes(x = host_subject_id_s,
            y = Abundance,
        color = sample_type_s)) +
  xlab("Individual") +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = sample_type_s), 
        stat = "Identity", 
        position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1),
        strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 360)) +
  ggtitle("Phylum abundance in hands and mice") +
  facet_grid(Phylum ~ substr(melted_phyloseq_obj$host_subject_id_s, 1, 1), 
             scales = "free_x")
```

### Figure 5. Abundance of each phylum in human hands and their respective mice

This figure shows the overall abundance of each phylum in each individual. Once again, it distinguished between each subject's hand and their respective mouse.

``` r
# phylogeny, yay!
plot_tree(phyloseq_obj,
          color = "sex_s",
          ladderize = TRUE) # this arranges the tree branches from short to long
```
